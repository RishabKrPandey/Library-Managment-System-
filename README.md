This is my project for **MAD 1 (Library Managment System)**. It is a multi user web based application, in which user can login and request for book and after approval from admin, 
user can read that book and return to library just like off line library.

**Technology Stack:**
  1) Flask
  2) Flask SQLAlchemy
  3) SQLite
  4) Bootstrap
  5) Datetime
  6) HTML Templates
